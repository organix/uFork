# uCode/Forth Language

Instructions in uFork are implemented
by a micro-coded machine-language we call _uCode_.
uCode is based on [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)).
However, uCode is not interactively extensible.
The uCode program is compiled as part of the build
of the uFork soft-core processor.

The uCode machine model
is a traditional zero-operand dual-stack machine.
A significant number of Forth words
are defined as primitive instructions.
Additional words are defined as procedures.
Procedure definitions are expressed
in terms of previously-defined words.

## Word Definitions

The following tables summarize the libarary of pre-defined words.
In these descriptions the following abbreviations are used:

  * **PC** -- program counter
  * **TOS** -- top of (data) stack
  * **NOS** -- next on (data) stack
  * **TORS** -- top of return stack

### Comments

When the compiler encounters `(` surrounded by whitespace,
it begins a comment that continues until the matching `)`.
Comments may be nested.
Otherwise, all words within a comments are ignored.

### Literals, Constants, and Variables

Word                | Stack Effect                          | Description
--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
`(LIT)` _data_      | ( -- [PC+1] ) PC+2->PC                | Push literal _data_ onto stack
`(CONST)` _data_    | ( -- [PC+1] ) ( R: addr -- ) addr->PC | Push literal _data_ onto stack and `EXIT`

When the compiler encounters a literal number,
either in decimal (e.g.: `-420`)
or hexadecimal (e.g.: `0x7F`),
it is compiled as `(LIT)`
followed by the number as _data_.
At runtime, this causes the _data_
to be copied to the TOS.

> _number_ `CONSTANT` _name_

If a literal _number_ is followed by `CONSTANT` and a _name_,
then the compiled `(LIT)` is converted to `(CONST)`,
which is `(LIT)` plus `EXIT` (in a single instruction).
The address of the `(CONST)` is added to the dictionary
as the procedure _name_.
Calling the _name_ procedure copies the _number_ to the TOS.

> `VARIABLE` _name_

When the compiler encounters `VARIABLE` followed by a _name_,
a variable location is allocated and initialized to `0`.
The address of the variable is compiled as a `(CONST)`
and the _name_ is added to the dictionary
as a procedure that produces the address.

### Calls, Jumps, and Definitions

If a word designates a procedure,
it is compiled into a _call_ to that procedure.
A _call_ copies `PC+1` to TORS,
and loads the `PC` with address of the procedure.

> `:` _name_ ... _body_ ... `;`

A procedure definition usually begins with `:` and ends with `;`.
The `:` _name_ adds a procedure label to the dictionary,
but does not generate any code.
Multiple labels (aliases) may preceed the _body_.
The `;` compiles to an optimized `EXIT`.
If the preceeding word in the _body_ was a procedure call,
it is converted to a _jump_ instruction (tail-call optimization).
If the preceeding word in the _body_ was an instruction with no R-stack effect,
the `EXIT` is added to that instruction (exit compression).
Otherwise, a stand-alone `EXIT` is compiled (`NOP` + `EXIT`).
Ending a definition with `EXIT` instead of `;`
suppresses any optimizations and compiles a stand-alone `EXIT`.
Additional labels within the _body_ create callable entry-points
for tail-segments of the definition.

The uCode machine supports several kinds control transfer
with the target `PC` compiled into the instruction.
A _jump_ is a basic unconditional transfer of control.
A _call_ additionally copies `PC+1` to TORS.
Either can be made conditional on a TOS value of `0`.
Auto-increment/decrement variants maintain a _count_
in TORS, jumping and removing the _count_ on `0`.
The compiler generates the appropriate instructions
for a variety of control-structures described below.

### Conditional and Looping Control-Structures

The uCode compiler implements several standard Forth control-flow words.

> _test_ `IF` ... _true-body_ ... `THEN`

Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, jump to the instruction after `THEN`. If it is not 0, continue with _true-body_.

> _test_ `IF` ... _true-body_ ... `ELSE` ... _false-body_ ... `THEN`

Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, jump to the instruction after `ELSE` and execute _false-body_. If it is not 0, continue with _true-body_. When `ELSE` is encountered, jump to the instruction after `THEN`.
 
> `BEGIN` ... _body_ ... _test_ `UNTIL`

Execute _body_, including the _test_. Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, jump to the instruction after `BEGIN`. If it is not 0, continue with the instruction after `UNTIL`. Note that this compiles to a single _jump-if-zero_ instruction from `UNTIL` to `BEGIN`.

> `BEGIN` ... _preamble_ ... _test_ `WHILE` ... _body_ ... `REPEAT`

Execute _preamble_, including the _test_. Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, jump to the instruction after `REPEAT`. If it is not 0, continue with the _body_. When `REPEAT` is encountered, jump to the instruction after `BEGIN`.

The uCode compiler also implements several non-standard control-flow words (although the `?R0` loop is similar to the standard `?DO` loop).

> _count_ `?R0` ... _loop-body_ ... `LOOP-`

Move _count_ from the D-stack to the R-stack. If it is 0, remove the _count_ from the R-stack and jump to the instruction after `LOOP-`. If it is not 0, decrement the _count_ and continue with the _loop-body_. Inside the _loop-body_, the _count_ may be copied from the R-stack to the D-stack by the word `I` (as in, "loop index"). When `LOOP-` is encountered, jump back to `?R0`, repeating the test and decrement.

> _-count_ `?R0` ... _loop-body_ ... `LOOP+`

Move _-count_ from the D-stack to the R-stack. If it is 0, remove the _count_ from the R-stack and jump to the instruction after `LOOP+`. If it is not 0, increment the _count_ and continue with the _loop-body_. Inside the _loop-body_, the _count_ may be copied from the R-stack to the D-stack by the word `I` (as in, "loop index"). When `LOOP+` is encountered, jump back to `?R0`, repeating the test and increment.

> _test_ `SKZ` _word_

Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, jump to the instruction after _word_. If it is not 0, continue with _word_. SKZ stands for "skip, if zero".
 
> _test_ `CALLZ` _word_

Remove the result of the _test_ from the stack. If it is 0, call _word_, which must be a procedure. If it is not 0, continue with the instruction after _word_. Note that this compiles to a single _call-if-zero_ instruction.
