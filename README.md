# μFork

A pure-actor virtual machine with object-capabilities and memory-safety.
The **uFork** processor architecture features
instruction-level concurrency,
automatic memory-management,
and fine-grained resource limits.

The blog post
"[Memory Safety Simplifies Microprocessor Design](http://www.dalnefre.com/wp/2022/08/memory-safety-simplifies-microprocessor-design/)"
describes the high-level architecture,
and the rationale behind it.

## Implementations

The initial prototype
was [implemented in **C**](https://github.com/organix/ufork-c)
and hosts a Scheme REPL with actor extensions.

The [Rust/WASM version](vm/wasm/README.md)
is a newer and more-robust implementation.
Multiple instances of the WASM component
can be instantiated to simulate a multi-core
or distributed system.

An [FPGA](fpga/README.md) implementation is in development.

### Technology Stacks

```
+-----+--------+-------+-------+---------+-------------+
| ASM | Scheme | Humus | Misty | ...     | Scheme REPL |
|-----+--------+-------+-------+---------|-------------|
| uFork-CRLF intermediate representation | uFork VM    |
|========================================|=============|
| Rust (no-std)                | Verilog | C           |
|------+-----+--------+--------|---------|-------------|
| WASM | ARM | RISC-V | Xtensa | FPGA    | Host O/S    |
+------+-----+--------+--------+---------+-------------+
```

The C proof-of-concept was built to run
in a traditional hosted O/S environment,
and does not track the evolving semantics
of the uFork IR (intermediate representation).

The Rust implementation (and eventually the Verilog)
conforms to a common uFork IR semantics.
The Rust code-base currently targets WASM,
but it should be possible to compile the core
for a variety of other Rust target platforms.
The future Verilog implementation
will target small FPGA devices
as a secure soft-core processor.

There is currently an assembler
that generates uFork IR
from a textual ASM format.
A compiler for a dialect of Scheme
with actor-oriented extensions
also generates uFork IR.
A univeral linker/loader
produces uFork memory images
from uFork IR.
Modules in uFork IR
can import and export symbols
regardless of their original source language.
Additional languages can be supported
by generating interoperable uFork IR.

## How To Run

Install the [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) package manager and run
`nix-shell` from the root of this repository. Alternatively, manually install
the relevant packages listed in [shell.nix](shell.nix).

Available Deno tasks are declared in [deno.json](deno.json). They are:

- `deno task build`: Build [the WASM component](vm/wasm/README.md).
- `deno task serve`: Start an HTTP server to locally host Web applications, such
  as the [uFork debugger](apps/debugger/README.md). Equivalent to starting
  [Replete](https://github.com/jamesdiacono/Replete) from your editor.
- `deno task test`: Run the project's [tests](docs/testing.md).
